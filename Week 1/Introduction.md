## Description of the problem.
For the final assignment of the Applied Data Science Capstone, I've decided to explore the problem of finding a suitable neighbourhood to open a new restaurant in Toronto.

The solution of this problem is aimed towards a possible investor who has these traits:

 * The investor has no particular interest in any neighbourhood or type of restaurant.
 * The investor is interested in the safest type and location of a restaurant that can be opened in Toronto.
 
The concept "safe" in this particular context means: finding the type of restaurant and neighbourhood that would improve the chances of the restaurant being highly rated according to Foursquare. 

To achieve the goal of determing the type and location of restaurant, I will try to model Foursquare restaurant ratings in Toronto. From previous observations of acquaintances who opened venues similar to a restaurant, I noticed they chose the venue and location out of convenience and personal taste, not if the market values that particular combination of location and type of business. They chose the location because it was close to where they lived, the type of business was a long time ambition and/or saw similar business nearby.

This model is aimed at a person who values objective data, regardless of what the data might show; assuming the data is properly obtained, prepared and presented.

Another reason I chose to build this particular is model is to reduce some uncertainties when a person attempts to start a business, in this case a restaurant. Out of all the possible decisions a person can make, what are the decisions that can have a bigger impact on the success of the business? How is the success of the business going to be measured? 

## Data.
